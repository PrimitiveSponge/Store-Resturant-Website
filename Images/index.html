            Welcome to Cafeteria Food (name of resturant). I hope you enjoy our food as we have options <br>
            of food from High Schools all over America. We have cuisines from the western coast and eastern coast. <br>
            They may sound like the same stuff but we assure you they taste Very different. We are known for <br>
            our accuracy on making it taste like the food in cafeterias. Little do they know that we steal food from cafeterias <br>
            and use it as our own. Thats why a Hamburger might taste different depending on what you get. <br>
            Our service is lightning quick because we don't bother with reheating it. We don't even refirigerate <br>
            it but just leave it out so it becomes room tempature. :) <br>
